# Awesome talks
[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

Over the years I have come across lots of recordings of talks online in my journey to learn on topics pertaining to my career and beyond it. While I used to gather them across different platforms it became difficult to curate and share the same with others under common themes.

In front of you now is a curated list of *awesome* talks that are worthy of your time. I will be updating this list regularly as and when I come across more *awesome* talks and while rummaging through my notes from years gone by. Suggestions are appreciated through a pull request.
